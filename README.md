SilexMultipleTwigServiceRepository
==================================

Version of the Fabien Potencier TwigServiceRepository which lets you have multiple Twig engine instances in a silex application

This Service Provider should be used as a replacement of the Silex Framework one.
If you use the Fabien's Potencier seed silex/silex, you can find the file to replace at:
<project_root>/vendor/silex/silex/src/Silex/Provider/TwigServiceProvider.php
